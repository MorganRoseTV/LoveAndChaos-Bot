# LoveAndChaos-Bot v0.0.3

LoveAndChaos-Bot is a Discord Bot specifically designed for a private server; this bot is merely a test and a method to expose MorganRoseTV to coding in python and to reintroduce them to the world of programming.

## Features

Currently there are minimal features, including a simple 8ball command, a ping command, as well as extension management commands: (load, unload, reload) and a stop command for the bot.

## Usage

#### ***Prefix: >***
### Commands:
#### Bot Management
**l**: Loads an extension\
**ul**: Unloads an extension\
**rl**: Reloads an extension\
**stop**: Stops the bot.
#### Fun Module
**8ball**: Returns a randomized response to a question.
#### Utilities Module
**ping**: Returns the bot's latency\
**makelist**: Makes a list from the user's message.

## Notes

As of now, there is no security to prevent users from using the management commands, that is on the list of things to do. Please don't break it if you have access to the server :)

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, though admittedly I do not know much about GitHub yet, so please be patient if I'm doing things wrong, thank you!
