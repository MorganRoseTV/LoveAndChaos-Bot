# LoveAndChaos-Bot v0.1.1

LoveAndChaos-Bot is a Discord Bot specifically designed for a private server; this bot is merely a test and a method to expose MorganRoseTV to coding in python and to reintroduce them to the world of programming.

## Usage

#### ***Prefix: !***
### Commands:
#### Bot Management
**load**: Loads an extension\
**unload**: Unloads an extension\
**reload**: Reloads an extension\
**stop**: Stops the bot.
#### Fun Module
**8ball**: Returns a randomized response to a question.\
**hug**: Allows users to give each other hugs.\
**bite**: Allows users to bite each other.
#### Utilities Module
**ping**: Returns the bot's latency\
**makelist**: Makes a list from the user's message.
#### Moderation Module
**bonk**: Sends a user to timeout for 5 minutes.\
**createrole**: Creates a role with the name set in the message.\
**deleterole**: Deletes the role with the name set in the message.

## Notes

As of now, there is no security to prevent users from using the management commands, that is on the list of things to do. Please don't break it if you have access to the server :)\
So far, it has taken Morgan 6 hours to get this far.
